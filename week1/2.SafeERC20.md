# SafeERC20

## Question

Why does the SafeERC20 program exist and when should it be used?

## Why SafeERC20 Exists

The SafeERC20 library exists because not all ERC20 tokens follow the exact standard protocol. While the ERC20 standard dictates that functions like `transfer` and `approve` should return a boolean value, not all implementations adhere to this, and not all developers test for it. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected behaviors in smart contracts interacting with these tokens. The SafeERC20 library ensures that these functions only proceed if the boolean return value is `true`, or if no return data is provided, ensuring no false negatives.

## Mitigating Approve/Allowance attack vectors

The SafeERC20 library also introduces SafeIncreaseAllowance and SafeDecreaseAllowance to prevent race conditions known as "approve attack vectors." These functions mitigate the risks associated with changing allowances.

### Attack Scenario

1. Alice approves Bob to transfer a certain amount of her tokens.
1. She decides to change the allowance and sends another approve transaction.
1. Bob observes the mempool and front-runs Alice's transaction, transferring the initially approved amount before her second approve transaction is confirmed.
1. Bob then executes another transfer for the new amount before Alice can react.

Example:

1. Alice sets Bob’s allowance to 1000 of her tokens, but sends 1100 by mistake.
1. Alice realizes her mistake, and sends another transaction with correct amount (1000 tokens).
1. Malicious Bob watched the mempool for new transactions, frontruns the second allowance and transfers to himself 1100 tokens Alice sent at first. Then, once the second allowance done, transfers 1000 tokens to himself. So, he made it with 2100 tokens, and not 1000 as planned.

### Mitigation with SafeERC20

Using OpenZeppelin's `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions prevents this type of attack by ensuring atomic updates to allowances, thus guaranteeing that no double-spending can occur.

Example:

1. Alice initially sets Bob’s allowance to 1100 tokens by mistake.
1. Alice realizes her mistake and initiates a decreaseAllowance transaction to remove the extra 100 tokens, attempting to set Bob's correct allowance to 1000 tokens.
1. Bob notices Alice's decreaseAllowance transaction in the mempool and attempts to front-run it by executing a transfer of 1100 tokens immediately before Alice’s decreaseAllowance transaction gets confirmed.
1. If Bob's front-running transfer is successful, he will transfer 1100 tokens, and the allowance will be reduced to zero as a result of the transfer.
1. When Alice’s decreaseAllowance transaction is subsequently confirmed, it will try to decrease the allowance by 100 tokens. However, since Bob's allowance is already at zero after his transfer, the decreaseAllowance transaction will revert. In any case, Bob's has no longer any allowance.

In this scenario, Bob spent 1100 while he spent 2100 in the attack scenario.
