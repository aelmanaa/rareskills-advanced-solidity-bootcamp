# Problems Solved by ERC777 and ERC1363 and Issues with ERC777

## ERC777 Overview

ERC777 is an advanced token standard that introduces several new features while being backward compatible with ERC20. It brings hooks that allow smart contracts to react to token movements, providing more complex interaction patterns.

### Issues with ERC777

- TokensReceived Hook Vulnerability: Malicious token developers could manipulate their token's behavior to bypass the `tokensReceived` hook of ERC777, potentially ignoring or circumventing checks when interacting with specific contracts.

- Trust Abstraction: The `tokensReceived` hook in ERC777 does not directly verify the original initiator (msg.sender) of a transfer. This can lead to potential abuse in scenarios where trust in the sender's identity is crucial.

- Reentrancy Attack Vector: The sequence in which the `tokensToSend` hook is called in ERC777 allows a reentering contract to perform actions against the sender's balance before the state is updated, which could lead to inconsistencies or exploitation.

- Contrast with ERC20: Unlike ERC20, where the state is updated before any external calls, ERC777's approach increases the risk of reentrancy issues.

An example of such a reentrancy attack can be found in a [blog post by OpenZeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/exploiting-uniswap-from-reentrancy-to-actual-profit) discussing an exploit on Uniswap.

## ERC1363 Overview

ERC1363 was introduced to overcome some of the issues with ERC777, particularly around security vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks.

### Why ERC1363 Was Introduced

- Reduced Reentrancy Risk: ERC1363's `transferAndCall` function simplifies the interaction, which potentially reduces the reentrancy attack vectors compared to ERC777's hook system. (the hook is called only once on the receiver side once the state is updated)

- Streamlined Functionality: ERC1363 focuses on specific use cases such as payments and avoids the broader and more complex hook system of ERC777, thus reducing security risks.

### Features of ERC1363

- Payable Token: ERC1363 introduces functions to make tokens payable and react to token transfers (`transferAndCall` and `transferFromAndCall`) or approvals (`approveAndCall`).

- Consistent with ERC20 Naming: The naming convention (`transferAndCall`, etc.) is in line with ERC20, maintaining familiarity while adding callback functionality.

- Focus on Recipient Side: Unlike ERC777, which has hooks for both senders and recipients, ERC1363 focuses more on the recipient side of transactions.

The full code implementation of ERC1363 can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1363/ERC1363.sol).
